# eops_macports
A MacPorts repository for ESO Observation Preparation Software [EOPS]

This repository provides a workaround to install the following EOPS packages via MacPorts:

1. KARMA for KMOS
2. FIMS for FORS2
3. FPOSS for FLAMES

FPOSS is also available from the [offical MacPorts repository](https://ports.macports.org/port/eso-flames-fposs/) and the [ESO Repository(https://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/installation/macports.html)].

FIMS is also available from the [ESO Repository(https://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/installation/macports.html)].

KARMA is also available from the [ESO Repository(https://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/installation/macports.html)], but only an old binary version that only works on Intel hardware. **This is the only version of KARMA available for Apple Silicon**.
